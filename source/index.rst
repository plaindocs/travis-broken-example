The :py:func:`enumerate` function can be used for ...
:py:func:`io.open`


Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

:math:`\underline{x}=[  x_{1}, ...,  x_{n}]^{T}`

.. math:: (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
 &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2

If :math:`\sigma_{1}` equals :math:`\sigma_{2}` then etc, etc.

    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray}
    y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
    f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
    \end{eqnarray}




.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
    :label: euler

Euler's identity, equation :eq:`euler`, was elected one of the most
beautiful mathematical formulas.

... when :math:`x < y` we have ...


Differentiating with respect to  and solving for 0 gives us

.. math::

    \min f(x) = \min_y f(x^k) + \langle y-x^k, \nabla f(x^k) \rangle + \frac{1}{2\alpha} \|y - x^k \|^2

Differentiating with respect to :math:`y` and solving for 0 gives us

.. math::

    W^{3\beta}_{\delta_1 \rho_1 \sigma_2} \approx U^{3\beta}_{\delta_1 \rho_1}

.. math::
    f(x^k) + \frac{1}{\alpha}(y - x^k) = 0

    y = x^k - \alpha f(x^k)

Now if the right-most term, :math:`\frac{1}{2\alpha} \|y - x^k \|^2`, was modified slightly to :math:`\frac{1}{2\alpha} \|y - x^k \|^2_B`. What is the meaning of this?! This new norm is to interpreted as follows: :math:`\|x\|^2_H = x^T H x`. Our modified solution is:

.. math::
    y = x^k - \alpha B^{-1} f(x^k)

The action of :math:`B^{-1}` in this case is dilation of our norm.
